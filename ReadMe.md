## Stock Analysis for Steve and His Parents

#### Overview:
Steve's just graduated with his finance degree and his parents could not be prouder of their son. As a present for his graduation, his parents wanted to gift him stock that they
want to invest into. They believe in green energy options and find a company named DAQO New Energy Group that makes silicon wafer for solar panels. Steve promised that he would look
into the companiesâ€™ stocks. He wanted us to analysis green energy stocks as well as DAQO stocks, to better help his parents diversify their stocks. He wanted us to measure how active
the stocks were, how they have grown, and their overall performance. We also made a table with formatting that would better aid Steve and his parents in their endeavors. After creating 
the worksheet for Steve we then went in and tried to make the program run quicker and a lot smoother for them for future stock analysis that they would like to perform.

#### Results:

I suggested that they investigate the stocks labeled "ENPH" and "RUN" based on the outcome of the analysis. In both years of 2017 and 2018 they had a positive return which indicated
that the stocks were growing successfully each year. Even more so than the others in which they were interested. The other stocks did really well in 2017 with the exception of 
one, but they had dramatic negative growth by the end of the year except the two that were listed above. As such those companies were going to be the best options for his parents
based on the criteria that he listed out. Here is a copy of the outcomes of the data on the tables:

I refactored the code from the earlier analysis to help Steve speed up the time it takes for the analysis to run. These are the time times for a before and after for you to see the 
comparison that the refactored code had on the analysis.

And here is the code that was refactored.

#### Summery:

1. The advantages of using refactored code is that you can save a lot of time using a formula that has already been written. It also is really beneficial to have equations or code snippets that
that are a bit obscure to normal means of getting those results, but they are more efficient and allow the code to run even faster. But that could also lead into its disadvantages were
the code that you are currently working on needs to be rewritten and is more prone to mistakes are you refactor it to work for the new project. In the end I would have to say that 
code refactoring is extremely helpful, but ultimately can be a headache as well.

2. Writing the original script was not that hard. It was really nice to be able to create statements that you understood fully. Ones that you put in there yourself. It was also really
nice not having to retype everything when I did start to refactor my code. I would say that I found it to be a bit more troublesome to refactor the code then it would just write an 
algorithms myself. Going by a different script was not as easy as plugging and playing. There were moments in the VBA code that I found to be completely different than the original, and 
was a pain to figure out why it kept throwing error codes. I eventually figured out a solution using quite a bit of googling, but I would say that next time I prefer to just create it all from
scratch so I know exactly the complexity of the code and how deep I want to dive into it.
